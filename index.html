            <p>Here are 12 tips that will help you shoot better black and white photography:</p>

            <ol id="list-group list-group-flush">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <p><strong>Plan your Shot in Black and White.</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Approach shooting with black and white in mind. Don’t just aim to take a nice photo, aim to take a black
                        and white photo.
                        Think about your shot as it would look in black and white by considering the lines, shapes, patterns,
                        textures, shadows, light, and shapes.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <p><strong>Consider Your Lighting.</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Remember that the lighting in your shot will now convey contrast, rather than color.
                        Overcast grey days can convey gloominess in a color photo, but might convey calmness in a black and
                        white photo.
                        A photo taken during golden hour might look warm when shown in color, but will show sharp contrasts when
                        converted to black and white.
                        Intensity of lighting can convey different emotions.
                        Softer contrast and a larger range of greys can give your photo a calmer look, whereas sharper contrast
                        with more dark blacks and whites can give your photo a moodier or dramatic look.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <p><strong>Shoot in Raw and Black and White (if you can).</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        One way to make thinking in black and white easier is to actually shoot in black and white, so when
                        looking at the image you are taking on your camera’s viewfinder,
                        you will be able to see them in black and white. Shooting in raw is good for a number of reasons, but
                        for black and white it is important for maintaining high quality of your shot,
                        for the smoothest possible grayscale, and to make editing color filters and white balance later on much
                        easier. (If you are shooting analog, using a phone, or certain types of cameras,
                        you may not have these options).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <p><strong>Use a Polarizing Filter.</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        A polarizing filter is used to reduce glare of reflective surfaces. They are most useful when shooting
                        water, wet surfaces, glass, metal,
                        or anything else than can produce glare. Polarizing filters are important for much of photography, but
                        they are even more important when used for black and white as glare can tend to
                        stand much more in black and white photos. There are some cases where you will want to use a polarizing
                        filter, you can read more about using polarizing filters here.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <p><strong>Look for the Abstract.</strong></p>
                    <img id="image" src="https://www.photographyinflux.com/static/bwbuilding.jpg" alt="Abstract image">
                    <p>
                        Abstract images can do very well in black and white, as we are able to focus on the lines and textures
                        of the image rather than the colors.
                        By shooting in black and white you can make regular textures become abstract. Think about negative
                        space, lines, patterns, darks, and lights, and texture.
                        Try shooting something very close up to get a new and abstract perspective.

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <p><strong>Overturn Expectations.</strong></p>
                    <img id="image" src="https://www.photographyinflux.com/static/PFBW-5.jpg" alt="Overturn Expectations">
                    <p>
                        The best black and white shots are rarely of something that was already close to black and white to
                        begin with. Often, it is of something that we would expect to see in color.
                        When color is removed the viewer focuses on other elements of the subject that they might not have
                        noticed before, this is especially true for something with vibrant colors that
                        normally would distract from other textures and patterns. The image that is most strongly transformed by
                        black and white is usually the most exciting.

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <p><strong>Use HDR.</strong></p>
                    <p>When done properly, HDR can be beautiful, especially with black and white as it is about perfecting
                        exposure levels in all areas of the photo.
                        To shoot for HDR, read our article on how to shoot HDR. Reminder: don’t use an HDR filter or HDR tool,
                        actually shoot for HDR.

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <p><strong>Find a White and a Black.</strong></p>
                    <img id="image" src="https://www.photographyinflux.com/static/black-and-white-bridge.jpg"

                    <p>
                        Your photo should have at least one true white and one true black. If not, it is either too bright, too
                        dark, or too grey. This is a basic rule of black and white photography
                        which helps you ensure you have the right amounts of contrast.
                    </p>

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <p><strong>Use Color Filters or Edit with Color Filters Afterwards.</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        You can control the tones of the black and white by using color filters. If you know exactly what you
                        are looking for in advance, you can apply a color filter to the lens of your camera,
                        or you can edit this in an image editing program afterwards. To find out what color filters can do for
                        your black and white images, read here.

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <p><strong>Dodge and Burn.</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Dodging and burning means making certain areas of your photo lighter and darker in an editing program
                        afterwards. You can do this to emphasize certain parts of your photos by
                        lightning them, de-emphasize other parts by darkening them, and fake more dramatic contrasts and
                        shadows.
